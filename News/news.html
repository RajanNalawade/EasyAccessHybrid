                        is a key market for us and we always ensure that the corporate ethos of SBI Life reflects in the
                        qualitative business practices in the region as well. This has led us to become forerunners in case

                        <br> On the recent launch of SBI Life’s new product, Mr. Sanjay Bhatnagar said, "Customer centricity
                        is our motto in all our businesses and processes. We realised that a man’s needs change as per his
                        age and situation and keeping these essentials at focus we have designed SBI Life - Poorna Suraksha.
                        It is a one of its kind plan, which is a non-linked non-participating, term assurance plan, with
                        an inbuilt Critical Illness cover. The plan offers coverage for a wide range of 36 critical illnesses.

                        Life Insurance Policy. This application makes the entire process of policy issuance faster and smooth
                        for the customers. With an intent to offer customers all information of their policy on their fingertips,
                        the Company offers ‘Easy Access’ - an intuitive mobile application which offers services like Renewal

                        which verifies the customer and product details with the customers before issuance of the policy.
                        This initiative has helped the Company in increasing persistency and decreasing the mis-selling cases
                        which in turn enhances customer satisfaction. SBI Life provides livelihood to 6620 plus local population

                        Chennai: The general notion of wo¬men wanting to invest in physical assets like gold and property need not be true. With
                        awareness about different savings products incre¬a¬sing, women prefer to invest in life insurance
                        products.
                        <br>
                        <br> A survey done by India First Life Insurance and Assocham found that life insurance was the most
                        popular choice of the respondents with at least 72 per cent wa¬nting to invest in it followed by
                        deposits both fixed and recurring at 69 per cent and mutual funds at 61 per cent.
                        <br>
                        <br> Of them, 49 per cent preferred to invest in real estate, 48 per cent in gold and electronic traded
                        funds and 43 per cent in PPF accounts. The choices that were least preferred by the respondents were
                        bonds (19 per cent), stocks and equities (21 per cent) and pension fund account (36 per cent).
                        <br>
                        <br> This popularity of life insurance can be attributed to the varied needs it covers, like that of
                        savings and protection in one go. It can also be inferred that our respondents prefer safe returns
                        co¬mpared to direct risks ass¬o¬ciated with equity or sha¬r¬es, but have started taking exposure
                        to equity through the mutual fund route. The lo¬wer preference of gold and real estate can be attributed
                        to the scenario changes post demonetisation.

                        for insurers," said RM Vishakha, MD and CEO of IndiaFirst Life Insurance Company.

                        <br> When it came to time ho¬r¬izon in terms of investment, 46 per cent prefer investing for less than
                        5 years, 38 per cent up to 10 years and 16 per cent more than 10 years to achieve their financial
                        go¬als. Majority of women (69 per cent) relied on their fa¬milies while making investment decisions
                        <br>
                        <br> Within life insurance, 47 per cent of the respondents preferred money back plans, expressing the
                        need for financial liquidity to maintain their expenses in the short term. Whole life policy was
                        preferred by 35 per cent as it provides coverage for life, help in meeting the retirement and long
                        term saving goals. Only 31 per cent preferred term life insurance.
                        <br>
                        <br> The respondents, which included both house wives and working women, were cl¬ear about their financial
                        priorities. Almost 68 per ce¬nt of the respondents wanted to use their surplus funds in investment
                        plans and ensure a secured financial future for themselves against activities such as beauty tre¬a¬tments
                        (6 per cent), short road trips (6 per cent), shopping online (12 per cent) or a coffee date with
                        friends (7 per cent). It also points to the scenario where women have started valuing their own needs
                        and are willing to make monetary decisions.
                        <br>
                        <br> Their top 3 financial go¬als to be fulfilled through investments the first priority was protection
                        of family and loved ones (73 per cent) and needs of children like education, marriage (50 per cent)
                        came in the second spot.

                        At a time when state-owned banks are in the cross hairs for lending to companies that eventually failed to service the debts,
                        not many would be aware that the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), country’s largest life
                        insurance company, has made investments of significant magnitude in some of these companies.
                        <br>
                        <br>LIC has been an investor in several companies which are in the list of applications admitted by National
                        Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC). The list includes
                        Alok Industries, ABG Shipyard, Amtek Auto, Mandhana Industries, Jaypee Infratech, Jyoti Structures,
                        Rainbow Papers and Orchid Pharma. Stocks of most of these companies have seen more than 95 per centvalue
                        erosions from their peaks thereby denting the overall performance of the insurance provider.
                        <br>
                        <br>They should also firm-up their Cyber Crisis Management Plan (CCMP) for handling cyber incidents more
                        effectively, the regulator said.
                        <br>
                        <br>Commenting on the company’s investments, Hemant Bhargava, managing director, LIC of India, said:
                        "In the last three years, we have taken a conscious decision of investing only in the BSE200 companies.
                        But you should know that LIC is an old institution and there are legacy investments about which there
                        is nothing much we can do."
                        <br>
                        <br>The state-owned insurance company has also been the largest shareholder and probably the only institutional
                        shareholder in companies such as Gitanjali Gems, Vakrangee, and Videocon Industries, which have been
                        in the news for the wrong reasons and alleged for poor governance and lack of transparency.
                        <br>
                        <br>Other well-known names which have been great value destroyers but can be found in LIC’s portfolio
                        include Reliance Communications, GTL Infra, Electrosteel Castings, Opto Circuits (India), Zylog Systems,
                        Rolta India, Aban Offshore, Shree Renuka Sugars and Monnet Industries.
                        <br>
                        <br>At the end of December 2017, LIC held more than 1 per cent in 378 companies. Of these, 68 companies,
                        or nearly one in every five companies, have a market capitalisation of less than Rs 100 crore.
                        <br>
                        <br>This is contrary to the perception that LIC invests in only large blue-chips.

                        Mumbai: The life insurance industry continued its positive growth in the month of February as private life insurers saw individual
                        annual premium equivalent (APE) grow at 11.4% year-on-year in February. Market leader, state-owned
                        Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), saw its individual APE grow at a slower 9.3% year-on-year
                        to Rs 2,343.2 crore in February than its private peers, showed data compiled by brokerage Edelweiss.
                        Even if we look at the data of the current financial year upto February 2018, LIC has registered
                        lower individual APE at 15.4% as compared to private players, at 28%. Senior officials in the insurance
                        industry say that, compared to the previous months there has been a slowdown across segments in February.
                        “While overall growth momentum seems to be moderating (partially due to base effect), we maintain
                        proclivity towards financial savings will persist and industry will regain growth momentum,” said
                        the Edelweiss Report. It added that, higher ticket size was probably the key growth driver for private
                        sector, implying a tilt towards unit linked insurance plans (ULIPs).
                        <br>
                        <br>Players like Bajaj Allianz, Kotak Life Insurance, Max Life, IndiaFirst Life Insurance and HDFC Life
                        Insurance continued to see positive APE growth. “In the month of February most of the growth came
                        from single premiums for both individual as well as group business. It is likely that, money might
                        be going to Ulips for tax purpose. With equity funds being taxed at 10% we hope that numbers in March
                        will also be strong for Ulips,” said a senior official with a leading insurance company. According
                        to the data from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai), first year
                        premiums in the month of February for life insurance companies surged 27% to Rs 13,698.52 crore from
                        Rs 10,791.68 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal.
                        <br>
                        <br>The Edelweiss report added: "Overall growth momentum (Ind APE) softened to 10.5% YoY growth in Feb’18,
                        post weaker growth recorded by both private players and LIC, which clocked sub-10% YoY growth (YTD
                        growth of 15%). Having said that, divergence was seen among players – while ICICI Prudential Life
                        and SBI Life were largely responsible for the soft growth (private growth, ex- ICICI Prudential and
                        SBI Life, stood at >22%), Max Life and HDFC Life reported better growth.
